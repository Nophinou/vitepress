    details: Former marketing guy. I was always more into the technical side of writing (learning about story structures, developing theme, etc.) than getting into the knitty-gritty part of it ; discovering video games in my mid-20s and specifically narrative design a few years thereafter allowed me to merge my interest in digital tools and the experience of writing stories.
