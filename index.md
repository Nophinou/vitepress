    details: Former marketing guy. I was always more into the technical side of writing (learning about story structures, developing theme, etc.) than getting into the knitty-gritty part of it ; discovering video games in my mid-20s and specifically narrative design a few years thereafter allowed me to combine my interest in digital tools and systems with the experience of writing stories.

    details: I'll always had a soft spot for fast-paced, action-packed indie platformers and roguelikes - from speedrunning Celeste to merely trying to finish a run of Spelunky or Risk of Rain. That being said, narration and ambiance such as found in Citizen Sleeper, OneShot, Outer Wilds, or Disco Elysium (yes, I have pretty unique tastes) are what drew me to the discipline.
