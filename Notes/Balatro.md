![WIP](/wip.webp)

- intermediary quests that bring benefits no matter the build -> gros michel / cavendish
- orthogonal design through subsystems: number of hands left tied to economy, so joker plays on that relationship
- multiple avenues for victory: score = chips x mult, different goals score wise even beyond joker build
- granularity in the process of scoring, card triggers + hand triggers + jokers triggers
