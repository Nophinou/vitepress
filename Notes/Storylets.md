# Storylets

::: info Definition
Discrete blocks of narrative content that traditionally affects stats and qualities. They can complete a pre-authored narrative or integrally define the world state (as in [Fallen London](https://www.fallenlondon.com)).

## Characteristics

Max Kreminski [defines](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/329067385_Sketching_a_Map_of_the_Storylets_Design_Space/link/5d046ceea6fdcc39f11b7073/download?_tp=eyJjb250ZXh0Ijp7ImZpcnN0UGFnZSI6InB1YmxpY2F0aW9uIiwicGFnZSI6InB1YmxpY2F0aW9uIn19) storylets as being:

- **Discrete**: there's a finite number of distinct storylets. 
- **Self-contained**: no storylet requires another to contribute to the overall story.
- **Reorderable**.
- **Gated by preconditions**:
    - Location is often taken into account;
    - More generally, named parameters determine a storylet's availability (more dynamic interpretations are possible like in Kreminski's <u>Starfreighter</u>, in which, to appear, a storylet might not require a specific material in the ship's hold but one that has a precise a specific attribute).



Storylets if done right are always **contextually relevant** and keep the player in a healthy midpoint between constrained linearity and overwhelming freedom. Qualities being integral to their operation, they effectively let the author **track** the player's behavior and let the game **react** in consequence with visible or hidden [meters](https://www.whatgamesare.com/2011/11/currencies-and-other-numbers-game-design.html).

[As noted by Hugo Labrande and Léonard Bertos](https://youtu.be/x5-EZrXYluA) (french), storylets as a system are:
- Granular 
- [Flexible](https://www.reddit.com/r/fallenlondon/comments/77iupx/is_accidentally_purchasing_500_weasels_an/), but system-wide changes and balancing are tedious
- Expandable

They also typically require a lot of content to work and a well thought-out system of filtering and surfacing.


## Content selection

1. The game filters all content that currently fits with the game state and the game rules
2. A selection is made, either by the game itself (again, like in a [salience-based narrative](https://emshort.blog/2016/04/12/beyond-branching-quality-based-and-salience-based-narrative-structures/) [à la Hades](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwdYL0KFA_U)) or by the player (typical of StoryNexus games).

If a character dies, bar storylets involving them from appearing !

## Handling numbers

Following [Tadhg Kelly's terminology](https://www.whatgamesare.com/2011/11/currencies-and-other-numbers-game-design.html), Emily Short [notes](https://emshort.blog/2019/12/03/storylets-play-together/) that regarding storylets:
- **Metrics** open or close content;
- **Currencies** (designed with lore in mind) are fungible and somewhat convertible;
- **Territory** usually works well with investigation / exploration gameplay;
- **Tools** open up new affordances and actions as long as future content justifies their existence ; another approach is to let them affect how other options play out (reducing risk in <u>Fallen London</u>, multiplying or dividing consequences, etc.).

## Player vs Author

Storylets are [author-generated bricks that compose player-generated stories](https://emshort.blog/2016/04/12/beyond-branching-quality-based-and-salience-based-narrative-structures/), as well as a powerful expression of tension [as described by Mata Haggis](https://youtu.be/8fXE-E1hjKk). Players are allowed to fit a gameplay need by weaving together storylets that don't belong together.




## Opportunities and ideas

- **Overall choices affecting the whole game or parts of it**: (see <u>Empress' Shadow</u> below). A direct analogy would be a game in which a cat burglar has to select tools or partners for a mission, which will influence its course.
- **[Tracking cumulative choices](https://emshort.blog/2020/01/09/casual-games-and-storylets-or-how-to-make-game-mechanics-express-choice/)** but the game needs to be able to respond in consequence.
- **Intermediate architectures**: just like you can have differentiated decks with special rules and contents (see <u>Below</u>), you can have some storylets trigger [various types of sequences](https://emshort.blog/2017/07/25/montage-and-other-effects-in-storynexus/). They are usually a great way to keep your [pacing](https://emshort.blog/2020/01/21/pacing-storylet-structures/) under control. For example:
    - Short-term choice that progresses the story.
    - Linear sequence in which you're locked until its end for intensity purposes.
    - Open-ended sequence that encourages exploration of a location, of topics in a conversation, where the player is not penalized for taking his time and absorbing all the available content.
    - Likewise, sequences that make use of a partially randomized deck dedicated to a specific narrative beat, which the player can exit at any time.
    - Epilogues that simulate the passage of time, give closure to a sequence.
- **Parameters**: letting storylets accept input and adapt to it (can be hard to localize).
- **Urgency and priority**: a useful subsystem in surfacing content in order to timely react to what just happened to the player.


::: info Some game examples
**Special decks**: Chris Gardiner's [Below](http://below.storynexus.com) has two dedicated ones with complementary gameplay and lore)

**Weighing parameters**: Emily Short's <u>Empress' Shadow</u> gives you more negative storylets if you chose to educate problematic students
