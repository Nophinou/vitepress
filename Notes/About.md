# About

These pages centralize the core components of what I've learned about narrative design. They're neither blog articles nor conference writeups, but rather operational notes that force me to structure my knowledge and give me a welcome refresher when I need one.

I'll link the relevant material when an article or a video is mentioned, but there's also a [bibliography](./bibliography.md) - and you're always welcome to holler at me to signal a broken link or to initiate a discussion.

Partially inspired by sebsauvage's [wiki](https://sebsauvage.net/wiki/doku.php?id=accueil) and Nicole van der Hoeven's [Learning in Public](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IE94ZZo6IVw).

I separated stubs and less full-fledged notes that don't directly pertain to my practice of narrative design into a section that's only accessible [here](./About.md). Those are much less about "what I know" and more about "useful stuff I don't need to be top of mind all day but might want to stumble upon again from time to time".
