# Branching narratives


::: tip Definition
Narratives that present alternative story developments that are generally incompatible with each other. They affect <span class="highlight">major story and characters elements</span>.

## Classic structures in choice-based games

From [Sam Kabo's Ashwell all-time great](https://heterogenoustasks.wordpress.com/2015/01/26/standard-patterns-in-choice-based-games/):

|Structure|Representation|Notes|
|---|---|---|
|**Time cave**|![Time cave](/time%20cave.png)|No variables, qualities, or stats|
|**Gauntlet**|![Gauntlet](/gauntlet.png)|Can be friendly or deadly<br> Low use of variables|
|**Branch and bottleneck**|![Branch and bottleneck](/branch%20and%20bottleneck.png)|High use of variables <br> Often used to represent the passage of time and the world's and the player's growth <br> Works better in big pieces|
|**Quest**|![Quest](/quest.png)|High use of variables <br> Works better in big pieces <br> Centered on exploration and environment <br> Narrative is fragmentary|
|**Open map**|![Open map](/open%20map.png)|Centered on exploration and environment <br>High use of variables <br> Narrative is either fragmentary or loose-paced |
|**Sorting hat**||High usage of variables at start, and then not at all <br> Lots of work: custom systems + branch-exclusive content|
|**Floating modules**||Akin to storylets, same requirements of wide content and explicit (?) stats <br> Grinding stats can be incorporated into the game's design|
|**Loop and grow**|![Loop and grow](/loop%20and%20grow.png)|Notion of ***runs*** <br> High use of variables <br> Justified by the narrative <br> Often backed by the theme of escaping some kind of imprisonment <br> Can be complified by using main branches|




## Small-scale patterns in choice-based games


|Structure|Representation|Function|Further opportunities
|---|---|---|---|
|Confirmation-required choice|![Confirmation choice](/confirmationChoice.png)|Offer several occasions to drop out of a dangerous / stupid decision | Measure the player's proneness to risk|
|Track switching choice|![Track switching choice](/trackSwitchingChoice.png)|Emulates indecision|Measure commitment, proneness to changing their mind|
|Scored choice||Aggregation of same-importance choices <br> |Decompose a big decision into many smaller ones to make a tendency emerge|
|Re-enterable conversation node|![Conversation nodes](/conversationNode.png)|<span class="highlight">Liven-up an exposition dump</span>|Track what they seem to be most spontaneously interested in <br> Gate options behind variables|
|Chapter one sorting hat|![Chapter one sorting hat](/chapterOneSortingHat.png)|Offers early game replayability|/|
|Endgame time cave|![Endgame time cave](/endgameTimeCave.png)|Pay-off setup <br> Seems most adapted to disjointed consequences, for global consequences use [narrative states](https://emshort.blog/2019/11/23/narrative-states/)|/|

## Embranchments don't matter

[Choices don't have to be impactful, they just have to feel that way](https://www.youtube.com/embed/TEa9aSDHawA). What matters most is having a <span class="highlight">compelling story</span>.

Players rarely replay their games, many branchs are not seen despite their number or quality.


::: tip Characteristics of a good main embranchment
- Produces changes in scenes or character's behaviors
- Allows unique ways of reaching one's goals
- Marks a turning point that may be remembered and reffered to later
- Doesn't produce disjointed narratives, only affects minor secondary elements (that can still be displayed in small scenes)

### How to build an embranchment

- Can stem from the order of scenes in the determined narrative, or the order the player learns key info in
- Can stem from major conflicts ands character's goals
- Good practice: first embranchment asap, then on a regular rythm (25/30min according to Episode Interactive's own Cass Phillipps)

::: info ex: Branching Ulysse's return to Ithaca
![Ulysses](/enEmbranchmentsDark.png){.dark-only}
![Ulysses](/enEmbranchmentsLight.png){.light-only}
‚ùóNot to be read as a geographical map, each segment can only be played once; to make the most of your content, you'd probably want your player to play every single segment once before getting to Ithaca. <br>
üí° Scoring choices at the end can be efficiently used in conjunction with [narrative states](https://emshort.blog/2019/11/23/narrative-states/)
