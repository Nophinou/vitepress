# Protagonists

## The player / protag unity

if character = action and action=gameplay, character = gameplay !!!!!

The framework "external actions show what a character wants" is not so easy to use since in many cases, the designer decides of the WANT (and in sandboxes, having an open WANT means playing a god or a pure avatar)

::: tip Empathy vs Unity
In linear media, you only need to create <span class="highlight">EMPATHY</span>; in games, you need <span class="highlight">UNITY</span>, which is hard to do when your protagonist's characterization goes against your player's.
:::

To still achieve this unity, [Jeremy bernstein recommends](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4mgK2hL33Vw) to focus on three aspects:


|Unity|Description|Importance| Toolbox |
|---|---|---|---|
|***Unity of traits***|Sharing the same external traits as your protagonist|Anecdotal| Custom character creation tool|
|***Unity of action***|Spontaneously acting like the protagonist would|Variable: you can accept going against your style if you recognize it is the style of the protagonist|Don't make the player take stupid decision just to justify gameplay, even good|
|***Unity of purpose***|Sharing the same purpose as your protagonist|Critical, even if the other unities are not respected, player and protag can be partners (see OneShot)| Focus on what we want and the reason why we care  |



## Handling emotions

:::info [Andrew S. Walsh](https://youtu.be/_lp0libfp5M):

<span class="highlight">The emotions explored in the game are not necessarily those experienced by the player!</span>

:::

### Three manifestations of emotion in an interactive environment

|Type|Principle|
|---|---|
|***Simulation***|Same emotions explored in the game and experienced by the player|
|***Representation*** |The protagonist is inserted in between; the emotional distance allows for an easier handling of negatve emotions. For the same reason, positive emotions need to be inferred from the protagonist's behavior.|
|***Abstraction***    |The emotion is expressed as a concept, eg. through player stats|

Those types can be combined as needed.

### Communicating emotion

|Type|Characteristics|
|---|---|
|***Tell emotions***|No interpretation phase. Without context, probably no feeling any emotional response. Compatible with abstraction.|
|***Show emotions***|Heavily reliant on interpretation, mistakes are possible. Player is active, the reaction is natural. |
|***Do emotions***|Context and player's interpretation make the action we perform signifying, it's not just a matter of "press X to be happy". Can be complicated with choice between several options, in the spirit of [reflective choices](./Choices.md#notable-choice-types). |


::: tip In summary
1. Who is feeling? 
2. What emotions is the player supposed to feel? 
3. How to communicate those emotions?
4. Why is the player supposed to feel those emotions?
