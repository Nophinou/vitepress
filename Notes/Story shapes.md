# Story shapes

## Kurt Vonnegut

</div>


According to Kurt Vonnegut, the shape of a story can be charted to represent its mood. Cinderella is the same overall story shape as the New Testament.

## Multiplicity of interpretations

<u>Hamlet</u> is kickstarted with the main character speaking with the ghost of the former king, who reveals the queen and the king's brother conspired to kill him.
BUT one can wonder:
- Is this really the king's ghost?
- Is he telling the truth?

Hamlet recognizes that there's no way to be sure, so he sets out to find a convincing confirmation, fails, and the bloodbath begins.

<span class="highlight">The shape of the story is radically different whether Hamlet is justified or not in his actions, ambiguity brings depth to the story themes.</span>

### Motivations

::: danger Prerequisite
Just like we establish in [Dialogue](./Dialogue.md), characters have external goals and internal motivations; they move towards their goal but ultimately are led throughout the story to satisfy their internal motivation.
:::



<div class="row">
  <div class="column">
  - <span class="color">Internal motivation</span> pertains to something the character doesn't know they need <br>
  - <span class="color">External motivation</span> applies to something they wish to change around them
<br>
<br>

  Those motivations cause <span class="highlight">change</span>! <br> <br>

### Plot structure

### Scene building

We build scenes according to our character's needs (to serve the story, do they need to learn anything? Do anything?).

In conclusion, per scene:
- OBJECTIVE: what lead wants to achieve
- CONFLICT: what prevents it from happening
- OUTCOME: what happens then (<span class="color">yes but</span>, <span class="color">yes and</span>, <span class="color">no and</span>)

### Debugging the player experience

1. Is the player's objective clear?
2. Is there escalating conflict, not just repetition?
3. Do the outcomes meaningfully add to the mechanics and/or narrative?
4. Was there change for the player or the character?

::: tips
- The character can fail while the player succeeds
- Internal change is more powerful than external change
- Breaks between events build tension
