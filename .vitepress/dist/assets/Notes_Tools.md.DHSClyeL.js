A dedicated editor might come along in the future, but for now all development has to be done in a code editing app such as <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Visual Studio Code</a>. It also lets you live test and debug your game in the middle of editing it.</p><h2 id="obsidian" tabindex="-1"><a href="https://obsidian.md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Obsidian</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#obsidian" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md)&quot;">​</a></h2><p>The general purpose notes app I like to use. Has the flexibility of markdown while still allowing you to include all the multimedia content you&#39;d like. Its most popular plugin (Excalidraw for Obsidian) lets you draw diagrams, lay out your content and embed any type of notes on a visual canvas, which is basically an enriched version of Miro if you don&#39;t need the collaboration aspect of it.</p><h2 id="affinity-photo" tabindex="-1"><a href="https://affinity.serif.com/fr/photo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Affinity Photo </a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#affinity-photo" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;[Affinity Photo ](https://affinity.serif.com/fr/photo/)&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Tried Krita for drawing small simple visual assets, but it was too powerful for both my skills and needs. Affinity Photo is a one-time payment of 60$ and a great middle between the daunting powerhouse that is Photoshop and the weaker (but great in a pinch!) Photopea. Has a bunch of small quality of life tweaks I thoroughly enjoy, but can have some very benign bugs at time.</p><h2 id="asset-forge" tabindex="-1"><a href="https://kenney.nl/tools/asset-forge" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Asset Forge</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#asset-forge" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;[Asset Forge](https://kenney.nl/tools/asset-forge)&quot;">​</a></h2><p>A basic 3D builder that comes with a variety of elementary blocks that you can dispose and apply simple modifications to very easily. Supports importing 3rd party models, great for building simple scenes if, like me, you don&#39;t know what you&#39;re doing.</p><h2 id="graphviz" tabindex="-1"><a href="https://graphviz.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Graphviz</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#graphviz" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;[Graphviz](https://graphviz.org/)&quot;">​</a></h2><p>A cool diagram generator that can use several algorithms to organize and display elements and their relationships in a visually appealing manner, no matter how complex they are. Quite rich in features if you bother learning its syntax, and very useful to <a href="https://grumpygamer.com/puzzle_dependency_charts" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">check and amend the logic behind your puzzles</a>. I recommend using <a href="https://www.edotor.net" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">edotor</a> and its live preview.</p>',11)]))}const c=a(i,[["render",n]]);export{u as __pageData,c as default};
