Phrasing then matters a lot, being succinct enhances absorption (see below) and is more visceral, giving flavor to the options can titillate the player&#39;s curiosity and put the emphasis on the character. When playing an already defined protagonist, playing with the conventions is very effective in highlighting their desires and limitations + always make room for characterization outside the scope of decisions (the player choses the action, the character their mode of expression).
