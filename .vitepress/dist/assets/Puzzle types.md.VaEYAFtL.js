Include clues or original mechanics that help navigate it: a map, a parrot that remembers directions, an ariane thread, a way to leave marks behind.

They often add to the game atmosphere and to the enunciating NPC characterization. Leave clues nearby and / or allow alternative solutions.</p><h2 id="wordplay" tabindex="-1">Wordplay <a class="header-anchor" href="#wordplay" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Wordplay&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Anagrams, adding or removing letters, usual expressions...</p><h2 id="cryptograms" tabindex="-1">Cryptograms <a class="header-anchor" href="#cryptograms" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Cryptograms&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Absolutely let the player know that it is a cryptogram puzzle (can easily be done through NPC characterization).

Calls for custom assets and animations, which will probably not be reused. Fundamentally a key that you bring to a lock, but can be a source of humor especially if you make the player make its own disguise instead of, say, buy it.</p><h2 id="coordinates" tabindex="-1">Coordinates# <a class="header-anchor" href="#coordinates" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Coordinates#&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Acquired completely separately, many combinations possibles with false ones.

Performing what seems like one simple action slowly evolves into an absurd sequence of reactions that prevent you from reaching your goal and each time forcing you to start over from the beginning (small progress is nevertheless achieved on every single attempt). Humoristic because of the sense that the game is actively toying with you.</p><h2 id="did-you-pay-attention" tabindex="-1">Did you pay attention ? <a class="header-anchor" href="#did-you-pay-attention" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Did you pay attention ?&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Question asked on a previously shared minor info.

Engine has to accomodate for it. Often what gives life to adventure puzzles according to Scarpia. They can remain very simple and still feel great.

Maybe deflect the player&#39;s attention toward elements that seem like they&#39;ll be necessary to the resolution. Needs to be either smart or funny.</p><h2 id="fiddleware" tabindex="-1">Fiddleware <a class="header-anchor" href="#fiddleware" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Fiddleware&quot;">​</a></h2><p>perform a task manually with controls akin to the real ones. Close to QTE if timer or skill needed, close to a physics puzzle if in a realistic simulation.</p><h2 id="magic-glasses" tabindex="-1">Magic glasses <a class="header-anchor" href="#magic-glasses" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Magic glasses&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Search for hidden elements in an environment thanks to a special device.</p><h2 id="hot-and-cold" tabindex="-1">Hot and cold <a class="header-anchor" href="#hot-and-cold" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Hot and cold&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Feedback as to whether you&#39;re close to the solution or not.

Learn to use / influence this chain for your own goals.</p><h2 id="bartering" tabindex="-1">Bartering <a class="header-anchor" href="#bartering" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Bartering&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Easy to implement, easy to solve. Acquire an item and perform an exchange. Said item might not be explicit and need to gather clues or to interpret NPC indications. Can easily bore the player because of how overexploited it has been.</p><ul><li>Clearly show the hurdle but leave the means of overcoming it open. Suggesting through dialogue the kind of solution that is expected is good practice.</li><li>Don&#39;t obviously put the solution near where it&#39;ll be used.</li><li>Always possible to combine this structure with another, variation is always good.</li></ul><h2 id="inventory-combination" tabindex="-1">Inventory / combination <a class="header-anchor" href="#inventory-combination" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Inventory / combination&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Either using a tool to transform an object into another (axe + tree = log) or combining several objects into a new one.</p><p>Verey often simply a step in a larger puzzle. Has to be logical without being either the obvious use of involved items or too arbitrary.</p><p>Expect players to try logical combinations that might somewhat make sense but are not correct; try to identify those through beta-testing and prepare reactions of some kind for them.</p><p>Good practice: use item descriptions and their flavour to prepare for their ulterior use.</p><h2 id="escape-rooms" tabindex="-1">Escape rooms <a class="header-anchor" href="#escape-rooms" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Escape rooms&quot;">​</a></h2><p>The solution is right near us but we can&#39;t see it yet. Sequences can be quite complex. Another potentially frustrating puzzle, the solution has to be somewhat original in its use of tools and strategies.</p><h2 id="remember-the-sequence" tabindex="-1">Remember the sequence <a class="header-anchor" href="#remember-the-sequence" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Remember the sequence&quot;">​</a></h2><ol><li>Observe</li><li>Understand that the sequence will be useful later</li><li>Memorize / note down the sequence</li><li>Apply the sequence</li></ol><h2 id="dialog-tree" tabindex="-1">Dialog tree <a class="header-anchor" href="#dialog-tree" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Dialog tree&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Find the correct sequence in a conversation.
