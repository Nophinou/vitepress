# Characteristics of a bad puzzle

## "Restore" puzzles

An unmarked door with deadly gas behind it that forces you to die with no chance of avoiding failure.

## Arbitrary puzzles

Effects that are not diegetically linked to their causes; the artificiality of the game becomes impossible to ignore.

## "Designer" puzzles

Puzzles whose solutions only make sense to you. You want to help the player beat the game, not show you're smarter than them.

## Binary puzzles

"Yes" or "No" puzzles that instantly cause success or failure. The player will simply reload a save and progress with no involvement. Always give lots of choices and make sure the player understands their meaning.

## Hunt the pixel puzzles

Self-explanatory.

# Characteristics of a good puzzle

## They are fair

- All the answers are in the game
- With enough prep and thought, it should be possible to complete the game on a first try. Don't withhold info.

## They're natural to the environment

If they're not arbitrary, then they must be deeply rooted in your setting and the people inhabiting it.

## They amplify a theme

Consequence of the need of preserving your world's internal logic. Don't make an animal rights activist shoot a guard dog to get into a secluded building.

# Handling Difficulty

How to modulate the difficulty of any given puzzle?

## Amount of bread crumbs

The directness of the information you're giving out to solve the puzzle.

Ex: when faced with a safe that's opened with an unknown combination, you could...

1. Have it written on the wall right next to it
2. Have it written under the rug
3. Have a picture somewhere, whose written date of taking is the combination (say 6/9/93)
4. Same as above, but with the addition of a note saying "Happy 50th anniversary" (you need to substract 50 years to the date)
5. Same as above,  but it's in its owner's wallet in the trash somewhere
6. Same as above, but the owner is British, so you need to invert day and month

## Proximity of puzzle to solution

Both **geographically** in the world and **temporally** in the playthrough.

## Alternate solutions

- Expensive to implement
- Might make the game too easy
- Might make the game prone to more bugs or exploits

## Steering the player

Requires responses to player inputs that don't align with the intended solution and providing little or big clues. An ideal player progression involves them accumulating knowledge about the puzzle by trying things out until a critical mass of information is reached; that way, they don't feel like anything was handed to them.

### Red herrings

Rarely needed since players tend to hard focus on their first idea.


# Puzzle design process

1. Create setting
2. Populate with characters
3. Create the role of the player
4. Give the player a goal
5. Assign a sub-goal to each scene
6. Create obstacles to the player's progression, materialized through an puzzle
7. Make sure that in the end, the player has a solid grasp of what is part of the present puzzle and what is part of the game's natural boundaries
